ImageMagick Ruby Cookbook
=========================

This is a growing collection of ImageMagick commands and related Ruby scripts. They are the basis of products at Cheergram.com, BIG Folio, and NextProof. 

Requirements
-----

No requirements other than ImageMagick and Ruby. Currently, I run these on the following versions: 

ImageMagick: 6.7.7-6

Ruby: 1.9.3p286

They run on both OS X (Mountain Lion) and Ubuntu 12.04. I have not tested them on older versions of ImageMagick or Ruby 1.8.7. 

Usage
-----

Each folder has a .rb file and some sample images. Most of them can be run in the command line like any Ruby script. Check the comments of each .rb file for details. 

Timing
-----

There's more than one way to skin a cat in ImageMagick. I've included some basic timing output in the scripts as I try my best to use the fastest method possible.
