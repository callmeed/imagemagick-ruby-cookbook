ImageMagick Ruby Cookbook
=========================

This is a growing collection of ImageMagick commands and related Ruby scripts. They are the basis of products at Cheergram.com, BIG Folio, and NextProof. 

Requirements
-----

No requirements other than ImageMagick and Ruby. Currently, I run these on the following versions: 

ImageMagick: 6.7.7-6

Ruby: 1.9.3p286

They run on both OS X (Mountain Lion) and Ubuntu 12.04. I have not tested them on older versions of ImageMagick or Ruby 1.8.7.
